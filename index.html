                    At least three people are dead and eight others injured after a gunman opened fire from a boat into a crowd outside the American Fish Company restaurant in Southport, North Carolina, Saturday night.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    According to Southport City Manager Noah Saldo, the shooting occurred just before 9:30 PM ET in the Southport Yacht Basin. Witnesses reported the suspect had been anchored near the waterfront for about an hour before opening fire on patrons gathered outside the popular seafood pub.

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    After the attack, the suspect fled south along the Intracoastal Waterway toward Oak Island. As of 11:30 PM, no arrests had been made, though authorities confirmed they are questioning a person of interest.

                    Southport, located about 20 miles south of Wilmington, is a small coastal town known for its quiet marinas and historic downtown. The sudden violence has stunned residents and visitors alike during what is typically a busy summer evening.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Emergency responders rushed to the scene, and all injured victims were transported to area hospitals. The conditions of the wounded remain unknown. A multi-agency manhunt involving local police, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, and federal partners is now underway.

                    “This was a deliberate attack on innocent civilians enjoying a night out,” said a spokesperson for the Brunswick County Emergency Operations Center. “We urge the public to avoid the Southport waterfront and report any suspicious watercraft immediately.”
                </blockquote>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Authorities have not released a motive or confirmed the suspect’s identity. However, they emphasized that the shooter acted alone and used a small vessel to approach the restaurant undetected before opening fire.

                    This is a rapidly developing situation. Officials ask anyone with information—including dashcam, doorbell, or marine footage from the area between 8:30 PM and 10:00 PM—to contact Southport Police at 910-457-7911.
