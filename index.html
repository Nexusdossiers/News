                    Early this morning, gunfire erupted outside a Dallas ICE facility when a suspect opened fire from a nearby building, killing at least four people and injuring several others before taking his own life.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    FBI Director Kash Patel announced during a press conference that initial evidence points to an ideological motive behind the attack. Investigators recovered a shell casing engraved with the words "ANTI ICE," suggesting the suspect's actions were driven by anti-immigration enforcement sentiments.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Federal authorities, including the FBI, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), are working alongside Dallas Police Department and Texas state officials to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the incident.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The suspect has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to law enforcement sources. Preliminary reports indicate that Jahn specifically targeted an unmarked van that was transporting immigration detainees to the facility. The coordinated nature of the attack and the suspect's apparent knowledge of ICE operations have raised concerns about potential surveillance of federal facilities.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The death toll has since risen to four, according to DHS officials, with multiple others sustaining injuries of varying severity. Medical personnel responded swiftly to the scene, and all injured individuals have been transported to local hospitals for treatment.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-red-600 pl-6 italic my-8 text-gray-700">
                    "This appears to be a targeted, ideologically motivated attack against federal law enforcement personnel and the immigration system they represent," said FBI Director Kash Patel during the briefing.
                </blockquote>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The Dallas ICE facility remains secured, and additional federal security personnel have been deployed to the area. Local schools and businesses in the vicinity were placed on lockdown as a precautionary measure, though most have since resumed normal operations.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    This remains an active and developing investigation, with officials expected to provide further updates later today. Authorities are urging anyone with information about the incident or the suspect's activities in the days leading up to the attack to contact the FBI tip line immediately.
