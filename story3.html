          At least one person is dead and more than 10 others injured after an active shooter opened fire at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on McCandlish Road in Grand Blanc, Michigan. The suspect—a 40-year-old male—drove a truck into the church entrance, opened fire with an assault rifle, and set the building ablaze.
