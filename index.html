                    Three people are dead and eight others injured after a gunman opened fire from a boat at the American Fish Company restaurant in Southport, North Carolina, on Saturday night. The suspect has since been detained by the U.S. Coast Guard in Oak Island.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    According to Southport Police Chief Todd Coring, the shooting occurred just before 9:30 PM ET at the Southport Yacht Basin. The suspect, traveling alone in a boat on the Cape Fear River, paused briefly at the restaurant and opened fire on patrons before fleeing south along the Intracoastal Waterway toward Oak Island.

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Shortly after 10:00 PM, the U.S. Coast Guard observed an individual matching the shooter’s description loading a boat at the NE 55th Street public boat ramp in Oak Island. That person was detained and is now in custody with the Oak Island Police Department. They will be transferred to Southport authorities for questioning with assistance from the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation.

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    “This was a very tragic night,” Chief Coring said during a 1:00 AM press conference, adding, “Just know you are as safe as you can be right now.” Officials confirmed there is **no known further credible threat to the public**.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Emergency responders transported all injured victims to area hospitals. The conditions of the wounded remain unknown. Extra patrols from multiple law enforcement agencies remain in place as a precaution.
                </p>

                    “This appears to be a targeted, unprovoked attack on innocent civilians,” said a Brunswick County Emergency Operations spokesperson. “We are grateful for the swift response by the Coast Guard and local law enforcement.”
                </blockquote>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The investigation remains in its immediate response phase. Authorities will release the suspect’s identity and formal charges as soon as they are available through official City of Southport channels.

                    Anyone with information—including dashcam, doorbell, or marine footage from the Southport or Oak Island waterfront between 8:30 PM and 10:30 PM—is urged to contact Southport Police at <strong>910-457-7911</strong>.
